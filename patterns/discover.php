                        <p>Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) therapy is the latest in skin rejuvenation treatments. The treatment is essentially the second generation of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy. PRF therapy takes PRP to the next level by retaining its beautifying benefits for an extended period. PRF is drawn from your blood and contains a mix of growth factors and stem cells.</p>

                        <p>Microneedling has become one of the most popular ways to improve your appearance and resolve cosmetic flaws, despite being minimally invasive. It can dramatically improve conditions like fine lines, wrinkles, dull skin, uneven skin texture, discoloration, enlarged pores, sun damage, acne and acne scarring. It achieves these benefits by creating micro-injuries throughout the face and flooding the skin with healing and growth factors — a cutting-edge treatment for the most frustrating aesthetic concerns.</p>
